# ü™ê About 
This portfolio, which I developed following my graduation from a coding bootcamp in 2021, serves as a testament to my professional growth. While it remains a work in progress, I also hold a deep appreciation for the thoughtfully crafted design choices it encompasses.

# ü§î What I would do differently 
- I would use Sass to implement mixins and functions.
- I would implement animations for smoother transitions between projects.
- I would showcase more screenshots of projects.
- I would clean up the code and create a component library. 

# Technologies used: 
- React, HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap
